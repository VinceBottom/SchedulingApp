# SchedulingApp
Developed to schedule research participants daily bedtimes for a sleep experiment.

It takes input parameters of the study condition, date of daytime session, and participant name, and generates
a document of instructions for the study. The instructions include bedtime and rise time by day calculated by study condition
and the time and date to arrive for the final lab visit.
